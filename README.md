# RGAT_with_BERT

This is the repository for our **IJCNN2023 paper**: RGAT: A Deeper Look into Syntactic Dependency Information for Coreference Resolution, by Yuan Meng, Xuhao Pan, Jun Chang and Yue Wang.

'RGAT_Model.ipynb' is the main code file, and the experiment results are also output in the file.

Our work is carried out on the whole GAP dataset. Because the results on the whole data set of GAP are basically consistent with the experimental results on a special subset of GAP data set, the results here are only obtained by experiments on a special subset of GAP data set in order to save time and accelerate the speed of recurrence. If you want to experiment on the entire data set, simply replace the data set with the entire GAP data set.
